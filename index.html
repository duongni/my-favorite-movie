        When you watch the film, you're seeing Hayao Miyazaki’s work and vision.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Designed as a very special coming-of-age tale, Spirited Away tells the
        story of Chihiro, a 10-year-old girl who navigates the labyrinths of
        life in a mystical microcosm inhabited by ancient spirits. Over the
        course of her journey in this alternate world, Chihiro learns valuable
        lessons about the fundamental nature of the universe as well as the
        importance of friendship. Through the use of soft world-building,
        Miyazaki constructs a memorable heterotopic environment that is
        infinitely nuanced and densely packed with mysterious entities that we
        don't quite know or understand. These magical creations linger on in our
        minds long after the film is over, shaping our own memories of the
        indelible experience of witnessing Miyazaki's mastery.

      <p>
        Miyazaki wanted a movie that was made for regular ten-year-olds. The
        main character had to be ordinary, with no special abilities or traits.
        The girls needed someone human to relate to and show them that they
        could be heroines too. The main character, Chihiro, was made with the
        girls from the cabin in mind. “Every time I wrote or drew something
        concerning the character of Chihiro and her actions, I asked myself the
        question whether my friend's daughter or her friends would be capable of
        doing it,” Miyazaki explained.

      <p>
        Quiet scenes of inaction, where a character might glance off into the
        distance or sit quietly, are a common occurrence in Miyazaki’s films. In
        an interview with Roger Ebert, Miyazaki explained the usefulness of
        these. "If you just have non-stop action with no breathing space at all,
        it's just busyness, But if you take a moment, then the tension building
        in the film can grow into a wider dimension. If you just have constant
        tension at 80 degrees all the time you just get numb."
